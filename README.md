# Guess The Number Game

## Overview
The **Guess The Number Game** is a simple console-based C++ game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a defined range. The game provides hints on whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the target.

## Features
- Random number generation for each game session.
- User-friendly input prompts.
- Feedback on guesses (higher/lower).
- Configurable difficulty levels.

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: C++

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prathameshatkare/guessthenumbergame.git
   cd guessthenumbergame
   ```

2. Compile the game:
   ```bash
   g++ guess_the_number.cpp -o guess_the_number
   ```

3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   ./guess_the_number
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to guess the number.

## Future Enhancements
